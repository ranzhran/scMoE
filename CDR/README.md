# DeepCDR
Cancer Drug Response Prediction via a Hybrid Graph Convolutional Network

The baseline code is from https://github.com/kimmo1019/DeepCDR
 
`DeepCDR` is a hybrid graph convolutional network for cancer drug response prediction. It takes both multi-omics data of cancer cell lines and drug structure as inputs and predicts the drug sensitivity (binary or contineous IC50 value).
