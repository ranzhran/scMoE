If you are interested in predicting the effect of a drug and its combinations, check the demo with all hyper-parameters for combo sci-plex dataset (`Lotfollahi et al., 2023 <https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.202211517>`_), check the following examples:

If you are interested in predicting the effect of CRISPRi or  CRISPRa perturbations (gene perturbations) and their combinations, check the demo with all hyper-parameters for (`Norman et al., 2019 dataset <https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax4438>`_), check:

If you would like to perform context transfer (i.e. predict the effect of a perturbation (e.g. disease) on unseen cell types or transfer perturbation effects from one context to another) check this example for INF-B stimulated cells from (`Kang et al., 2018 <https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4042>`_), check:

If you would like to perform batch effect removal on gene expression space as well as latent space, check this example:
