# DeepDDs
Deep graph neural network with attention mechanism to predict synergistic drug combinations

The baseline code is from https://github.com/Sinwang404/DeepDDS/tree/master
 
`DeepDDS` is a deep learning model based on graph neural network and attention mechanism to identify drug combinations that can effectively inhibit the viability of specific cancer cells. The feature embeddings of drug molecule structure and gene expression profiles were taken as input to multilayer feedforward neural network to identify the synergistic drug combinations.
